***Container***
* flex-direction
>row(default) || row-reverse || column || column-reverse

*flex-wrap
>wrap || nowrap(default) || wrap-reverse

*justify-content
>flex-start(default) || flex-end || center || space-around || space-between

*align-items
>flex-start(default) || flex-end || center || stretch || baseline
>>stretch value is visible if you dont specify children's height 
******************

***Item***
*order
>any number (+/-)
>>by default, all items have order = 0, an item with a
higher/lower order value will go higher/lower, respectfully.

*grow/shrink
>0 || any positive number
>>resizes the item, relative to the space of its container

*flex-basis
>auto || any number(+unit(px/% etc))
>>works the same as max-width, but works hand-in-hand with 
the set width of the item. "auto" isnt effective when a certain 
width of the item is being set, but becomes effective when min-width
is set. It also doesn't override the max-width and grow properties. 

*flex(shorthand)
>values:grow shrink basis
>>grow.default == 0,shrink.default == 1, basis.default == auto 
>>flex:none: === grow == 0, shrink == 0, basis == auto.
>>flex:default === grow == 0, shrink == 1, basis == auto.
>>flex:auto === grow == 1,shrink == 1,basis == auto
		(relative flex-items,with widths determined by content)
>>flex:1 === grow == 1, shrink == 1,basis == 0
		(absolute flex-items, equal widths, irrespective of content)
*************

*auto margin
>>once used on flex-items, the justify-content property becomes ineffective
