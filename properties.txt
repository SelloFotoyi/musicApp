***Container***
* flex-direction
>row(default) || row-reverse || column || column-reverse

*flex-wrap
>wrap || nowrap(default) || wrap-reverse

*justify-content
>flex-start(default) || flex-end || center || space-around || space-between

******************

***Item***
*order
>any number (+/-)
>>by default, all items have order = 0, an item with a
higher/lower order value will go higher/lower, respectfully.

*grow/shrink
>0 || any positive number
>>resizes the item, relative to the space of its container

*flex-basis
>auto || any number(+unit(px/% etc))
>>works the same as max-width, but works hand-in-hand with 
the set width of the item. "auto" isnt effective when a certain 
width of the item is being set, but becomes effective when min-width
is set. It also doesn't override the max-width and grow properties.
