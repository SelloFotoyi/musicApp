# musicApp
<h6>Music player web application</h6>
* The purpose of this project was to explore my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript. At its inception, I had few ideas on the features and for this release/version, the following checked list of features have been accomplished:
- [x] user can upload and play mp3 files
- [x] theme color, font style and default image can be changed
- [x] a song from the playlist can be played by clicking on it, as well as deleting it by clikcing its corresponding delete icon 
- [] the app can extract metadata (artist, album etc) from the loaded mp3 files
- [] a styled, non-default audio element

* The next release(s) will check all those unchecked set features
* A Javascript framework was not used for the following reasons:
  * I wanted to explore Javascript's basic functionalities, concepts and capabilities in a bid to cement my basic knowledge of the language.
  * To appreciate and acknowledge the impact of a framework on the language, once it's used in either the following realease of this project, or on other future projects.  
* Bug:
  * A song deletion from the playlist increments the logic of selecting a song by the number of deletions made. For instance, after deleting a particular song from the playlist and clicking on any song you want to play, the app will play the suceeding song on the list.
